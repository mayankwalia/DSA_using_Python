# Shortcuts in Jupyter Notebooks
## There are two modes: edit mode and command mode.
You are in edit mode if your cell has a green border. In edit mode, you can type into the cell normally. Enter edit mode by pressingENTER on your keyboard or clicking within a cell’s editor area.

### 1. Cell edit mode
Command mode has a blue border. In command mode, you edit the notebook as a whole, but cannot type into individual cells. You can enter command mode by pressing ESC on your keyboard or clicking outside a cell’s editor area.
